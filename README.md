# Gentoo Linux
Gentoo Linux is a meta-distribution linux distribution, meaning that you as the user are responsible for customizing your system, even by its components such as its kernel. Unlike other well-known linux distributions, it is a source-based distribution, meaning that the user has the preference to compile the source code from any package of their preference themselves for optimizing their system, which is achieved using Portage. 

However, Gentoo Linux meets its issues very commonly on the fact that it takes a very long time to compile the source code using Portage, which requires tweaking the settings from make.conf to ensure that based on the user's preference that matches their criteria. 

It is critical and even essential to always update & upgrade source-based linux distribution as any lack of change ccan result in conflicts of files, which is not like binary-based distributions.
